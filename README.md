=======================
![Alt text](VPN-Action.png)

This action for Launchbar 6 will allow you to connect/disconnect to your VPNs in Viscosity by navigating in to "VPN's" where you will be given a visual indicaiton to the VPN's current status. 

Activating a gray connection will start the VPN while activating a orange/green connection will disconnect it.

Big thank you to [John Purnell](https://github.com/jpcirrus) for adding sorting to the VPN and helping with the code!
